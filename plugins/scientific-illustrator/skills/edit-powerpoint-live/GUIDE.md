# Edit PowerPoint or WPS Presentation

Act as the presentation Drawer in the four-role Scientific Illustrator protocol. Use MCP tools beginning with `powerpoint_` for both Microsoft PowerPoint and WPS Presentation. Match the draw.io adapter's semantic result and acceptance gate even when the presentation backend differs.

## Select the host backend

Call `powerpoint_status` and `powerpoint_get_capabilities` with `host_application=auto` unless the user explicitly chooses `powerpoint` or `wps`. Apply these backend rules:

- Windows Microsoft PowerPoint: use the live COM backend.
- macOS Microsoft PowerPoint: prefer `officejs-context-sync` when the Scientific Illustrator task pane is connected; every object command must complete `context.sync()` before continuing.
- macOS Microsoft PowerPoint without a connected task pane: use the isolated native OOXML working copy and label it as a file-backed fallback, not live object-by-object drawing.
- Windows or macOS WPS Presentation: use the same standard editable PPTX working-copy backend and open it in WPS.

Set `SCIENTIFIC_ILLUSTRATOR_PPT_HOST=wps` only when a task must force WPS across calls. Do not claim COM-style in-memory attachment in file-backed mode. Report the `backend`, `host_application`, managed path, and renderer from tool results.

Ordinary drawing must not monopolize the desktop. Keep the default `powerpoint_set_focus_policy` value `preserve`, which updates COM, Office.js, or the OOXML working copy without repeatedly foregrounding PowerPoint/WPS. Use `foreground` only when the user explicitly asks to watch every step and accepts that the presentation stays in front. `powerpoint_activate_slide` is the explicit one-time foreground handoff. Focus policy may change during a session because it does not mix document backends or object models.

For live Mac PowerPoint work:

1. Call `powerpoint_officejs_status` before any presentation mutation.
2. If the certificate or manifest is not prepared, give the user the reported `officejs-setup.mjs prepare` and `sideload` commands. Never alter macOS certificate trust automatically.
3. Ask the user to trust the reviewed localhost certificate, restart PowerPoint, open **Scientific Illustrator Live** from **Insert > My Add-ins**, and keep the task pane open.
4. Call `powerpoint_set_backend` with `backend=officejs` and wait for connection. Do not start drawing unless it succeeds.
5. Keep one backend for the entire task. If the session is locked to OOXML or Office.js, start a new Codex task before switching.

## Respect read-only requests

If the user requests inspection only, call `powerpoint_status`, `powerpoint_get_capabilities`, and `powerpoint_inspect`, then stop without creating, editing, exporting, or saving.

## Establish a safe session

1. Call `powerpoint_status` first.
2. Call `powerpoint_get_capabilities` before selecting object types.
3. Call `powerpoint_inspect` before editing an existing deck.
4. Keep `powerpoint_set_focus_policy(preserve)` unless the user explicitly requests foreground drawing. For new COM/OOXML work, call `powerpoint_new_presentation` with the selected `host_application` so an unrelated open deck is not modified. Office.js cannot create a desktop presentation; require the user to open a blank deck and connect its task pane first.
5. Preserve an input deck by default and save an edited copy unless in-place save is explicit.
6. Use absolute paths and never use operating-system mouse, keyboard, or screen automation.
7. In file-backed mode, treat the managed working copy as authoritative. Save the final `.pptx` to the requested path and visually check the export in the actual target application because WPS and Microsoft PowerPoint can render fonts and charts differently.
8. In Office.js mode, use an absolute `.pptx` output path with `powerpoint_save`; PowerPointApi 1.10 exports the current editable presentation through the task pane.

Do not close a presentation unless explicitly requested. Closing and quitting require their tool safeguards.

## Map the shared semantic contract

| Semantic object/operation | PowerPoint implementation |
|---|---|
| Editable text | `powerpoint_add_textbox` (native PPTX text box in every backend) |
| Editable symbol/panel | `powerpoint_add_shape` using capability ids/names |
| Free arrow/axis/tick | `powerpoint_add_line` with endpoint clearances |
| Attached relationship | COM/OOXML: `powerpoint_add_connector` with explicit sites; Office.js: a named geometry-backed routed group because the API exposes no connection-site binding |
| Editable table | `powerpoint_add_table`, cell updates, and `powerpoint_update_table_layout` |
| Editable regular chart | COM/OOXML: native chart with embedded data; Office.js: named editable shape composite because the API exposes no chart insertion |
| Repeated motif | duplicate, group/ungroup, and z-order tools |
| Exact layout | `powerpoint_align_shapes` and `powerpoint_distribute_shapes` |
| Structure review | `powerpoint_audit_figure` plus `powerpoint_inspect` |
| Renderer review | `powerpoint_export_slide_image` |

If PowerPoint exposes a reconstructable semantic object and the MCP supports it, use it. Never substitute a screenshot.

## Inventory before drawing

Use the Designer's specification or extract an inventory from the reference. Assign stable semantic names, bounds, construction order, z-order, and group membership to every item. Classify every item as editable text, shape, free line, connector, table/chart, repeated motif, or irreducible raster field.

## Enforce atomic images

Use `powerpoint_add_image` only for one tightly scoped irreducible visual field. Require:

- a specific `raster_reason`;
- `source_is_tightly_cropped=true` or explicit crop fields;
- `atomic_raster_unit=true`;
- `contains_reconstructable_content=false`;
- a precise `decomposition_note`.

Split prediction grids, mask comparisons, channel stacks, microscopy arrays, and before/after blocks into separate pictures. Rebuild all text, frames, grid lines, legends, arrows, axes, tables, and regular plots as native objects.

In Office.js mode, pre-crop every atomic picture before calling `powerpoint_add_image` and set `source_is_tightly_cropped=true`. `ShapeFill.setImage` does not expose PowerPoint crop properties. Do not silently insert an uncropped source.

## Draw one region at a time

1. Establish slide size, margins, panel bounds, alignment anchors, spacing tokens, z-order, and connector lanes.
2. Draw one logical region from background to foreground with stable names and nonzero pacing. Prefer `powerpoint_draw_sequence` with `pacing_mode=per_object` when the user wants object-level checkpoints. Background focus preservation still applies; switch to `foreground` only when the user explicitly wants PowerPoint/WPS kept in front. Use `checkpoint` or `fast` when requested or when performance is more important than animation.
3. Use fixed text geometry, explicit margins, wrapping, alignment, and controlled autofit.
4. Use attached connectors for semantic relationships in COM/OOXML. In Office.js, inspect the reported `connector_mode=geometry_backed`, use exact orthogonal routes and explicit endpoint clearances, and re-run the renderer gate after node movement.
5. Apply start/end clearance so free arrowheads do not enter rectangles.
6. Use exact align/distribute and table-layout tools instead of visual guessing.
7. Group a region only after its internal objects remain individually editable and its local gate passes.

## Mandatory Reviewer-Corrector loop

After each completed region:

1. Export the current slide through `powerpoint_export_slide_image`.
2. Run `powerpoint_audit_figure` and inspect named objects.
3. Give structure and renderer evidence to `$audit-scientific-figure`.
4. If it reports any finding, give the findings to `$correct-scientific-figure`.
5. Execute the returned object-level operations.
6. Export and audit again.

Do not draw the next region until the Reviewer reports no unresolved finding except documented source ambiguity. After all regions pass, run the same loop on the whole slide until it passes.

## Acceptance gate

Require exact readable semantics, 1.00 reconstructable editability, 1.00 clipping/overlap safety, at least 0.95 layout/alignment confidence, at least 0.95 connector clarity, at least 0.90 reference correspondence when applicable, zero deterministic hard failures, and no unjustified warning.

## Delivery

Inspect once more, save the editable `.pptx` with `powerpoint_save`, and export PDF only when requested. Report the selected application and backend, stable object counts, native/table/chart/group counts, picture count, every raster declaration, local and whole-slide Reviewer results, renderer used for preview, and remaining application-specific ambiguity.
